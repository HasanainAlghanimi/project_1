# About
Our group chose a dataset that focuses on credit card fraud. We analyzed that out of the 3000+ cases, there were only 20 cases of fraud. These specific cases focused on two individuals, both elderly and living in small towns. We studied trends in which fraud expenses increase and compared that to the pattern of fraud in our data set. One of the challenges mentioned in our dataset suggested determining whether the cases found were indeed fraud, we used that challenge to fuel the direction of our study. 
# Questions for Analysis
What time of year is credit card fraud most likely to occur?
Does age or gender impact risk of fraud?
Who is more likely to perform fraudulent activity? Loved ones or strangers?
Does credit card fraud occur more via online transactions or with a physical card swipe?
Does location contribute to risk of fraud?
